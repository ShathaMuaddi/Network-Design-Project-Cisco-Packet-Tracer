# 🌐 Network Design Project – Cisco Packet Tracer

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **multi-network topology designed and simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer**. The network consists of multiple routers connected through serial links, with each router serving a separate local area network (LAN) via switches and end devices.

Each LAN is assigned a unique IP subnet ranging from **192.168.1.0/24 to 192.168.4.0/24**, with routers configured as default gateways to enable communication between different network segments. The design highlights core networking concepts such as IP addressing, routing between networks, and hierarchical network architecture.

This project is intended for educational and training purposes and provides hands-on experience in network design and device configuration.
